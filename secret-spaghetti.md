### Ingredients:

- 200g spaghetti
- 100g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan)
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the spaghetti.
2. While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta or guanciale and garlic cloves. Cook until the meat is crispy and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic cloves.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese.
4. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta or guanciale. Toss to combine and coat the spaghetti with the rendered fat.
5. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring continuously to create a creamy sauce. Add some reserved pasta cooking water, a little at a time, if the sauce is too thick.
6. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper to taste.
7. Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated cheese and black pepper, if desired.
